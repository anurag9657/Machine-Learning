R Implementation of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository consists of R lanaguage implementation of following machine learning algorithms.
1. Decision Tree - CART algorithm with prunning
2. Neural Network - forward and backword propagation
3. Support Vector Machine - comparison and analysis of different kernels.
4. k-nearest neighbor
5. Boosting - Adaboost
6. Bayesian Learning

These algorithms have been implemented on Amazon reviews sentiment analysis dataset and Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset.

1. Amazon reviews sentiment analysis dataset
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html
This dataset consists of Amazon baby product reviews a subset of a larger amazon review collection. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets.

2. Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits
This data set consists of preprocessed normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13 to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into non-overlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions.
